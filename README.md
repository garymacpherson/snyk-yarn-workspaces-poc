How to recreate issue:

1. git clone
2. `npm install -g yarn`
3. `yarn set version berry`
4. `yarn install`
5. `snyk test` // you will observe this will work without issue but with a warning that it is only testing the root project
6. `snyk test --all-projects` // fails due to no node_modules folder in the child paths (this is fine as it can be resolved by using `--yarn-workspaces`)
7. `snyk test --yarn-workspaces` // zero result

Running step 7 with the `-d` flag shows that snyk fails to pick up the workspaces correctly.

You can add/change any value you want to the `workspaces` section in the roots `package.json` and it does not change the following output. In fact you can entirely delete it and it still behaves the same.
